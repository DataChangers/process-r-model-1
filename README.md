# Use PROCESS for R to analyze your data (Model 1)

## work in progress, examples and code will follow!

Andrew Hayes developed the PROCESS macro for mediation, moderation and conditional process analysis. He also wrote a fantastic book about it: [Introduction to Mediation, Moderation and Conditional Process Analysis](https://www.guilford.com/books/Introduction-to-Mediation-Moderation-and-Conditional-Process-Analysis/Andrew-Hayes/9781462549030).

I made several Excel templates to help you [graph conditional effects](https://www.md2c.nl/process-graphing-templates/), but these were always based on SPSS output only.

The good news is that Hayes also developed PROCESS for R. So now you can graph your conditional effects for free! Well, that is, nearly for free, as my templates are 3.99 EUR. But if you are a student or a researcher and you can't afford those expenses, just reach out to me!
